     <h1>Hi there, I'm Anderson üëã</h1>

As an experienced Operations Manager, I leverage my background in Information Technology Management and AI Engineering to drive process improvements and optimize operational efficiency. My Scrum Master certification, AI Engineer certificate, and graduation in Advanced Project Management have equipped me with a solid foundation in agile methodologies and AI-driven solutions, allowing me to effectively manage cross-functional teams and deliver results in tech-driven and data-centric environments.

I have hands-on experience in logistics and manufacturing software design, where I applied modern technologies and automation to solve operational challenges. Passionate about continuous learning, I am dedicated to building innovative, AI-powered solutions that streamline processes, enhance decision-making, and improve business performance.

<h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
Actively expanding my technical skills by studying and developing projects using:

<h5>React | Vue | Next.js: For dynamic, responsive front-end applications.</h5>
<h5>Node.js | Express: To create efficient, scalable back-end systems.</h5>
<h5>HTML | CSS | JavaScript: The building blocks for crafting clean, accessible web interfaces.</h5>
<h4>My Approach:</h4>
<h5>With several years of experience in managing operations, I bring a solutions-oriented mindset to every project. I‚Äôm excited to apply Agile methodologies to tech projects, keeping the user at the center and ensuring continuous improvement.
Feel free to check out my repositories and follow along as I build out my knowledge in full-stack development!</h5>
